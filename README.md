# Electric-Car-Usage

We have been tasked to understand electric car usage. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. An example of claim to test would be "Is the number of Bluecars taken in area X different than in area Y? Is it greater in area X than in area Z? Etc‚Äù. The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. You can also consider postal codes 75015 vs 75017 to some of the areas of interest.

## Problem Definition
Investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

## Defining the question
Investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset, Identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made.

## Defining the metric for success
The objective of this project is to investigate the claim listed above and know whether or not the the average number of blue cars taken is different that of the blue cars returned
